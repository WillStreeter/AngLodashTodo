# AngLodashTodo
Interview Question asking me to use Lodash, $cacheFactory  to create simple todo list


1. 1st) npm install (did not create karma test ...all we really want is the npm install of http-server)
2. 2nd) bower_components directory does not build then run -> bower install
3. 3rd)  -> http-server -a localhost -p 8000
4. 4th) finally past http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/ in a browser
